      <p class="mb-4">The cathedral and surrounding buildings were raised in the western part of the Alba Iulia Citadel,
        on the site of a gatehouse near the Roman Plateau. It was thought of as a continuation of the former metropolitan seat at
        Alba Iulia (then called Bălgrad), where Michael the Brave built a stone church in 1597. When the citadel was
        rebuilt in its current form in 1713–1714, the Habsburg authorities demolished this and its materials were used
        to build a new church near where the railway station is today.

      <p class="mb-4">A wooden memorial church in the southeastern part
        of the citadel marks the site of the former metropolitan cathedral.

        Built in 1921–1922, the cathedral was ready in time for the coronation of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie as
        monarchs of Greater Romania on October 15, 1922. This event, which took place in the same city where the Union
        of Transylvania with Romania occurred on December 1, 1918, was meant to give the union added symbolic and
        religious weight. Ferdinand, a Roman Catholic, objected to being crowned inside an Orthodox church, so the
        coronation ceremony was held outside in the courtyard. In commemoration of the event, busts of the king and
        queen were placed on the grounds in 2008.</p>

      <h3 class=" my-5 text-center">Roman Catholic cathedral</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The diocese of Gyulafehérvár was founded by Stephen I of Hungary in 1009. The construction of the
        first
        cathedral was begun that time, though was completed only in the end of the century, under the rule of Ladislaus
        I. During the same period, towards the end of the 11th century they began constructing the second cathedral. The
        transversal naves and the first part of the sanctuary of the present cathedral were built in Romanesque style.
        During the Mongol invasion of 1241, the church was destroyed. In the middle of the 13th century the cathedral
        was rebuilt on the old foundation, in the transitory style between Romanesque and Gothic. Not much later, in
        1277, Saxons pillaged the cathedral and set it on fire.

      <p class="mb-4">In the 15th century, the building was reconstructed. In
        1439, it was again damaged after a Turkish invasion during the Ottoman–Hungarian wars. The archbishop of
        Esztergom and the regent-governor of Hungary, John Hunyadi contributed to the reconstruction – this was the time
        when the latter one chose the cathedral of Gyulafehérvár as a burial place. During the first part of the 16th
        century, the building was improved, and further parts were added to it. In 1601, during the Wallachian invasion
        led by Michael the Brave, the cathedral was pillaged, even the tombs of the Hunyadis were damaged. In 1603, the
        Habsburg army, led by Giorgio Basta sieged the building. In 1658, during the next invasion of the Ottomans, the
        cathedral was damaged again.

      <h3 class=" my-5 text-center">The Citadel</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The medieval fortress was part of a fortification system created by Prince Eugene of Savoy
        designed to ensure
        the defenses of the newly conquered provinces of the Habsburg Empire. It is one of the most representative
        Vauban bastion fortification in Transylvania, and it became one of the Roman Empire's main fortifications in the
        area.
        The foundations for the city and citadel were laid out in 1711, and between 1713 and 1715 the whole land was
        cleared by tearing down the old city, which was moved on the Eastern side of the Fortress, and by building
        around the Roman castrum. Over 20,000 Romanian peasants worked on the construction of the Citadel, as well as
        several Italian workers and artisans. The main body of the citadel has a heptagonal shape, with a bastion being
        located in each corner, and the outside walls having a length of approximately 12 km. The Citadel also has a
        gate on each wall, but the main gate is on the Eastern side.

      <p class="mb-4">Today, the Alba Carolina Fortress became one of the
        main attractions of the Alba Iulia county, by providing a unique historical and medieval ambiance. It is very
        accessible from Cluj-Napoca, and you can explore it through different tours and day trips. An important feature
        that attracts thousands of tourists each year is the Guard Change of the Citadel. The guards are dressed in
        uniforms specific to the XVIII century, and they welcome the tourists at the gates of the Citadel. This ceremony
        began in 2009, and throughout the years it became a symbol of the Alba Carolina Citadel. The Guard Change
        Ceremony takes place daily during the touristic season (May - September) at 12:00, and sometimes twice a day
        during weekends. For a unique memory, tourists can take photos with the guards, who are dressed according to
        their category: infantry, cavalry, artillery, or commanders.
